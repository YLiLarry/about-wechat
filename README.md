加拿大一家研究机构发布最新研究发现，微信对中国和海外用户采取不一样的审查过滤机制。

根据中国相关法律法规，互联网公司往往需要对内容进行过滤。

多伦多大学蒙克全球事务学院跨学科实验室公民实验室（Citizen Lab）的这一最新报告说，微信使用了一种“一APP两制”的内容过滤机制，区别审查中国和海外用户。

微信是全球第4大社群媒体平台，每月活跃用户有8.06亿人。

微信不仅是聊天应用，还提供支付、叫车与其他服务，母公司腾讯有大举进军海外的野心。

中国政府通过“防火墙”审查政治敏感的网络内容。

公民实验室此前的研究报告揭露了微信公众平台、新浪微博、Tom-Skype和新浪UC等即时通讯软件以及直播平台上的审查机制。

相关报告的作者之一Jason Q. NG通过电子邮件对BBC中文网表示，令人担心的新现象是，微信审查变得不透明，用户不再像以往那样或像在很多其它社交媒体平台那样收到任何信息被过滤提醒，而这使得微信上的交流不可靠。

他还指出，在这一报告之前，只有两个微信审查关键词为外人所知，而该项调查报告发现了174个关键词。这些几乎所有这些关键词都仅在超过两人以上的聊天中被过滤，显示微信对多人交流施以更多审查。

公民实验室最新研究的主要发现包括：

关键词过滤仅仅针对那些用中国大陆手机号码注册微信号的用户，即便这些用户之后更改绑定的手机号，用海外手机号码绑定原有微信号，审查机制也依然存在。

关键词审查不再透明。过去，如果某条信息被过滤，微信用户会收到提示，但现在审查变为悄然进行。

比起一对一聊天模式，群组聊天中有更多的关键词被过滤。群组聊天中的信息往往能被更多人阅读。

关键词审查不是静态不变的。一些在最初研究时发现被过滤的关键词在随后的测试中能被成功发出和收取。一些在研究后期新发现的关键词则常与新闻事件有关。

微信自带的浏览器对中国用户屏蔽了一系列赌博、色情、邪教的网站以及对部分对中国持批判立场的新闻网站。微信在对中国用户屏蔽这些网站的同时，海外用户可以在不收到任何安全浏览警告信息下进入这些网站。但微信同时也被断断续续地对海外用户帐号屏蔽部分赌博、色情网站。

中国对网络信息进行严格审查，脸书（Facebook）、推特（Twitter）等全球流行的聊天软件被屏蔽，谷歌（Google）也被迫退出中国市场。

今年9月，中国的最高法院、最高检察院、公安部联合发布《关于办理刑事案件收集提取和审查判断电子数据若干问题的规定》，确认公检法人员“有权依法向有关单位和个人收集、调取电子数据”。

这一以部门文件形式制定并颁布的规定并没有经过相应立法程序，但中国最高法称其依据是《刑事诉讼法》等有关法律，并称其目的是“为规范电子数据的收集提取和审查判断，提高刑事案件办理质量”。

相关规定所称的电子数据包括网页、博客、微博、微信朋友圈、贴吧、网盘等网络平台发布的信息。这一规定已于今年10月1日开始施行

Researchers Expose Censorship on Popular Chat App, WeChat
December 1, 2016

Toronto, ON – Researchers at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab are publishing a report today that reveals how WeChat (the most popular chat app in China) censors content. The results show WeChat has separate censorship policies for users in China and internationally, with the majority of censorship targeted for China accounts, and has removed notifications to users about the blocking of chat messages on the platform.

The researchers also found that there is more censorship in “group chat” messages compared to one-to-one user chats, possibly due to concerns about posts being spread to larger audiences and leading to mobilization, and that WeChat’s built-in browser also blocks certain websites for both China and International accounts.

WeChat is the dominant chat application in China and fourth largest in the world, with 806 million monthly active users. The application thrives on its huge user base in China, but like any other application in the country it must follow strict content regulations.

“Attention usually focuses on foreign companies attempting to reach into China and facing hard decisions over how to approach its strict content regulations. WeChat has

the opposite dilemma. To gain wider success the app must maintain its base in China, all while staying within the Chinese government’s boundaries, and present a compelling experience to attract international users,” says Masashi Crete-Nishihata, Research Manager, Citizen Lab, Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto

The report finds that WeChat enables keyword filtering for users with accounts registered to mainland China phone numbers. Remarkably, the researchers found that censorship stays on even if users switch to a non-mainland phone number or travel to a different country — “locking in” users with mainland China accounts to its system of censorship no matter where they go.

“It’s unclear if the persistent content restrictions we’ve detected for China accounts is intentional, but the outcome is concerning. If you register a WeChat account to a Chinese phone number you will always be under additional censorship, even if you travel or later link your account to an international number. The idea that you can’t escape a censorship system imposed on you at the time of registration is a troubling one indeed,” explains Jason Q. Ng, Research Fellow, Citizen Lab, Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto.

The researchers systematically tested a sample of keywords in two WeChat modes: one-to-one

chat and group chat. They found a greater number of keywords blocked on group chat, which suggests that group chat is specifically targeted, potentially because of its ability to reach a larger numbers of users. Censored keywords spanned a range of content, including current events, politics, and social issues. The report also found that censorship on WeChat is dynamic. Some keywords that triggered censorship in our original tests were later found to be permissible in later tests. Newfound censored keywords also appear to have been added in response to current news events.

“When you send a message on WeChat it passes through a remote server that contains rules for implementing censorship. If the message contains a keyword or set of keywords that have been targeted for blocking, the message will not be sent,” explains Jeffrey Knockel, Senior Researcher, Citizen Lab, Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto

The report goes on to detail how, in both one-on-one and group chat, censorship now happens without user notification. Previously, if a user sent a message with a blacklisted keyword a warning would pop up explaining the message could not be sent. Now messages are censored without giving any indication that it has been blocked.

“The removal of the censorship notices means WeChat has become even less transparent and also less dependable for its users in how it handles their communications,” says Lotus Ruan, Research Fellow, Citizen Lab, Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto

In addition to keyword censorship, WeChat implements a URL filtering system in its built-in browser. The researchers found 41 websites blocked exclusively for Chinese WeChat accounts, including online gambling, news and media websites that critically report on China, and the website of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (icij.org), which reported on the Panama Papers. All of the sites that were exclusively blocked on China accounts were fully accessible on International accounts without any warning page, but the researchers also found intermittent blocking of gambling and pornography websites on International accounts.

Unlike chat censorship, when a website is blocked on WeChat a variety of explanatory messages are provided for why the censorship has occurred. However, it is unclear how accurately the purported explanations match up with the actual reasons for why websites are blocked. This ambiguity in truly attributing the source for the filtering again reflects the lack of transparency in how WeChat determines what “sensitive content” to block.

Overall, this report shows the importance of understanding how the apps we use everyday actually work.

“Days are long gone when we used to interact with the Internet as an undifferentiated network. The reality today is that what we communicate online is mediated by companies that own and operate the Internet services we use. Social media in particular have become, for an increasing number of people, windows on reality. Whether, and in what ways, those windows might be distorted — by corporate policies or government directives — is thus a matter of significant public importance (but not always easy to discern with the naked eye),” says Ron Deibert, Director, the Citizen Lab, Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto.

The Citizen Lab, based at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs, has extensive experience uncovering Internet censorship practices through network measurement and reverse engineering techniques.
